# Project Overview
Welcome to the "Real-Time Streaming with Azure Databricks" repository. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for real-time data streaming and analysis using Azure Databricks and Azure Event Hubs, with visualization in Power BI. It's an in-depth guide covering the setup, configuration, and implementation of a streaming data pipeline following the medallion architecture.
